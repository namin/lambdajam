Workshop on Program Transformations
-----------------------------------

We'll guide you in writing your own Scheme-to-C translator by
demystifying the program transformations that make a higher-order
functional program run on a spartan host. You'll learn about
continuation-passing style, representation independence,
registerization, and trampolining. We first illustrate the program
transformations step-by-step on some Scheme programs, and then
challenge you to automate the steps!
